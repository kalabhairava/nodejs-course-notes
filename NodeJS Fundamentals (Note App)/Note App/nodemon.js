// Automatically restarts a node app as you make changes

// To do this, install `nodemon` module.
// nodemon watches your files for changes, and restarts the node app.
// nodemon is a command line utility that gets executed from the command line
// Install it as a global module

// Running a node app using nodemon
// Run `nodemon {file_name}`
// It runs `node {file_name}` internally, and watches files for any changes.
// As soon as a file changes, it restarts the node app so that we don't have it manually do it everytime we change something
